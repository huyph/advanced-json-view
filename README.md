# Summary
This extension will pretty-print JSON data and it can memorise current view state.

Only works on Chrome at the moment.

# How to use
Follow these steps to install this extension to your Chrome:

1) Go to "chrome://extensions/" on Chrome

2) Tick "Developer mode" checkbox

3) Click "Load unpacked extension..."

4) Choose this directory

5) Disable any other JSON extension you might have, since they might conflict with this one

6) Then you are all set. Start using the extension by either dragging a json file into your Chrome, or going to a page that returns a json.

# Known issues: (that will be addressed soon)
- Auto view preservation stops working after "Expand all" is chosen
- Error message causes toolbar to overlay top of JSON file
